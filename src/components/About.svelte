<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="text_container">
    <p>With four years of freelance full-stack development experience under my belt, I've had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse clientele, primarily students, throughout my bachelor's degree journey. While my expertise lies in full-stack development – it's been my bread and butter – I've explored a myriad of domains, from machine learning and IoT to web and application development. I'm the kind of developer who thrives on versatility, always eager to dive into new challenges and technologies.</p>
